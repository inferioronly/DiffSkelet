We present representative reconstructions of genuinely degraded paleographic images obtained with a model trained exclusively on synthetically degraded data. (See pictures/real_world_eval)

Because pristine reference images for these real samples are unavailable, objective image-quality metrics cannot be provided. 

Nonetheless, qualitative inspection shows that the restored outputs exhibit markedly sharper and more discernible character strokes.
